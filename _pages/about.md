__Short Biography__: Bo Dong is a Sr. Computer Scientist of [Center of Vision Technologies](https://www.sri.com/computer-vision/) (CVT) at [SRI International](sri.com). He leads numerous sensing program activities for SRI. At the intersection of computer graphics, computational photography, and deep learning, Dr. Dong's research covers a wide range of applications in next-generation imaging systems, especially in degraded conditions (e.g., high dynamic range, ultra-fast motion). Currently, Dr. Dong focuses on bio-inspired visual systems and processing the visual information using an asynchronous event-driven method. He received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the College of William and Mary in 2015.
